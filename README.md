# joinposter-api

It's API client for the Poster system.
Sorry, there are no any documentation, because this package has status WIP.
I pushed it to npm because I'm using this package in my own projects and it's usfeul and comfortable for me during development and testing.
All functionality and docs will been implemented a little bit later.
Also, there are some 'not clear' code or behavior of some functions.
